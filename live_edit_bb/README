Example of live edit interface accomplished via Backbone views/models

Requires python and Flask:
1) Install python 2.7.x (http://python.org/download/)
2) Install setuptools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)
3) Run
	$ easy_install flask

To start the server:
$ python server.py

NOTES:
-Needs some refactoring, but the basic idea should be clear
-Doesn't have a proper idea of inspection sections yet, but that should just be another layer of similar abstraction
-Updates to the backbone model are not handled at all yet, but that shouldn't be particularly difficult to add on
